## Prototype Videogame based on the Arrow Television Show

Built using the Unity game engine from 2020-2021 based on the CW show The Arrow. This project was meant to test out the basics of a game engine as I prepared to build a game idea that I had in the Unreal Engine. I learned how scripting works, how the Scene Editor works, and how rigging works for character animation.

Used a model of the Arrow character online and used a rigging software to allow for the character to move in game. Used C# scripting along with a Bow and arrow model to code for the bow being drawn back and the arrow being shot with realistic physics, and the arrow sticking to the surface that it landed on. 

Used available online city models to build a simple city, with buildings, sidewalks, lampposts, etc. Experimented with some procedural generation as well, but I did not use it that much.
